                    Nudge was my first website I made from scratch with good ole html and css. When I first started looking for websites to make, I had just finished the html/css module in Treehouse and CodeCademy. I felt like I was ready to take on a huge website, but quickly discovered that a lot of websites were using javascript for user interactions. I felt like I needed an easy starter project that still had a sleek design. Nudge met all my needs and I had a lot of fun making it. <br><br>

                    There are a couple pages I left out on purpose. I didn’t want to copy everything from the website and the main focus was to prove to myself that I could make a website from scratch using self taught methods. I picked the pages that I thought were most challenging and left the rest alone. I think once I was done with the pages I did make, I was ready to move on to learning javascript.

                    I learned a great amount from this first site. One of the biggest lessons I learned about was responsive web design. I ended up reading a book on it, called “BLAH BLAH BLAH”. It explained how important response web design is and how to use it properly. Once you notice something like that, you don’t stop noticing it. These days, I pay extra attention to how responsive websites are.<br><br>

                    Since I was fairly new to css, I also googled a ton of different css properties and learned about browser support. One of the biggest problems I had on this project was vertical text. Since there’s always multiple ways to do something, I wasn’t sure which method was better. I eventually found a method I liked for the vertical text, but I didn’t know exactly how different an element could look in different browsers. This came later after building a couple more projects.
